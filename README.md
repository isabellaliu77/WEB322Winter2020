## Exam 2 Starter Pack
This project is the "starter pack" for your exam 2.
The Project contains the following :
  * The Entry point file for the exam is called exam.This file has all of the mandatory code that you will need(importation of Express, the creation of the app object, creation of Express Server, handlebars middleware, body-parser middleware). 
  * In this file you will only be require to define your routes and write the logic for them.
  * Regarding the directory structure, most of it has been created for you. I created the following folders :
    ** (public- img ,css
    ** views- layouts- main.handlebars)
  * Regarding your views, you would be required to create the neccessary template files that goes within the views as per the exam requirments.
  * Express and Express-Handlebars are both already installed, verify this by checking the package.json
  
Please note, after you download this project to your computer, open it in VS Code, then open the terminal and lastly run the command **npm install**. That command is needed to download the node_modules folder into your project so that you run it!
