## Basic Express App
This Project is a Basic Express app. The 3rd party package Express was imported to handle all the HTTP request in the app.
There are 3 routes :
  * "/" (Home Route) - When a user navigated to this route they will be take to the Home page of the app which is a static HTML page. 
  The static HTML page was created and then fetched using the **fs** package and then processed and returned to the user
  * "/about" (About Us Route)- When a user navigated to this route they will be to the About us  page. This page is a dynamic page 
  and was dynamically created by our Express app
  * "/contact" (Contact Us Route)
  
 
Please note, after you download this project to your computer, open it in VS Code, then open the terminal and lastly run the command **npm install** That command is needed to download the node_modules folder into your project so that you run it!
