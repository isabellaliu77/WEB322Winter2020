## Variable Declaration (ES6 Syntax)
### let
* let allows does not hoist variables like the var keyword
* let allows you to declare variables that are limited to a scope of a block statement, or expression on which it is used, unlike the var keyword, which defines a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope. 
### const
* The value of a constant can't be changed through reassignment, and it can't be redeclared.
* Constants are block-scoped, much like variables defined using the let statement.
